# Materials
This is a set of materials - Python scripts, dictioaries etc. - that were used in approach described in article "Identification of proteins and genes associated with Hedgehog signaling pathway involved in neoplasm formation using text-mining approach" (Big Data Mining and Analytics journal)

We prepared Python scripts, that after downloading allow (1) downloading texts of abstracts from PubMed database ("Abstracts download.py"), (2) recognition of protein ang gene named entities ("Protein and Gene NER.py"), (3) extraction of associations between protein and gene named entities ("Protein-protein association extraction.py"), (4) collection of aditional information on proteins and genes from he UniProt database ("Proteins_UniProt_info.py"). These scripts are universal, i.e. could be used for any protein and gene named entitiy recognition and associations extraction (not only associations with the Hh pathway proteins and genes). For our work, we used automated filtarion of extracted associations by UniProt identifiers according to the following principle: if UniProt id of one out of two interacting proteins is present in the list of Hh pathay proteins ("HH proteins info.txt") we consider this association suitable, otherwise, we exluded such association. Additional files required for name recognition and association extraction: (1) English-stopwords.txt - the list of stopwords which are used for tokens' features, (2) Non-specific (proteins).txt - the list of non-specific words which are used for tokens' features, (3) pred_proteins.pkl - pre-trained and saved CRF model for protein and gene named entity recognition

Since Human Disease Ontology, that was used as a dictionary for neoplastic diseases named entities recognition, is a comprehensive ontology on any human diseases, we have first filtered out all terms that do not belong to "Disease of cellular proliferation" branch ("DOID_filtered_ext.txt"). We provide several scripts for disease and protein and gene named entitiry recognition and relation extraction: (1) dict-based diseases - recognition of neoplactic diseases in the textsusing aforementioned processed file of Human Disease Ontology, (2) dict_based proteins - allows recognition of Hh pathway protein names using dictionary ('HH proteins info.txt'). Associations for disease-protein relations were extracted by the follwing pronciple: if the name of prtotein and disease were mentioned in the same sentence, we considered it as associations. Relations between Hh interactors and neoplastic diseases are extracted by the following steps: (1) CRF-based recognition of proteins ("Protein and Gene NER.py"), (2) comparison by UniProt identifier with the list of Hh pathway interactors ("Hh-interactors-list.txt") and filtering out ones that do not beong to it, (3) recognition of neoplastic disease names ("dict_based proteins.py"), (4) search for pairs "disease-proteins" which were mentioned in the same sentence.
